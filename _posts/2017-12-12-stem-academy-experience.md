  My experience in stem has been pretty good so far. Some of the classes are a little complicated but I have been able to understand most of it. I like what the stem academy has offered and the opportunities that it will give me in the future. It is a challenge but it will ultimately make sense at the end and it will all be worth it. 
  All snapple bottles have a fact on the top.
