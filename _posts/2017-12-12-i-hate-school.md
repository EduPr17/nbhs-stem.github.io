title: "I Hate School"

I really don't like STEM, its too much work. I don't enjoy doing homework, classwork, tests, etc... 
The classes are extremly for me. I don't enjoy struggling in classes. Especially my engineering class, I dont like that class. 
I'm not good with computers and this class is all about them. All the coding and stuff is too hard for me to comprehend. Overall I just 
hate school and all the harder work that STEM brings doesn't make it any better. Of course non of this is true because this is just 
an irrelevent post.
